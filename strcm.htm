<p><b><font size="5" face="Verdana"><a name="About"></a>About the STRCM</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The STRCM consists of a standalone command line utility
(STRCM.exe) and documentation for how to integrate the STRCM with existing
remote control software products.&nbsp; <b>The STRCM utility does NOT provide
any remote control functionality itself</b>, but rather is an &quot;integration
helper&quot; utility that can install, view, and configure some remote control
software products.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The STRCM can automatically check for, and start, a
number of pre-configured service names on the remote computer prior to invoking
the remote control software's &quot;viewer&quot; application.&nbsp; This allows
for greater security, control, and flexibility.&nbsp; The STRCM can also stop
the remote service after the viewer program has terminated, again&nbsp; allowing
for increased security.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>The STRCM is a FREE utility and full source code is
provided (under GNU licensing provisions).</b></font></p>
<hr color="#008000">
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="5"><a name="Downloading"></a>Downloading and
Installation</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To download the STRCM, visit:</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.systemtools.com/strcm_frame.htm"><font size="2" face="Verdana">http://www.systemtools.com/strcm_frame.htm</font></a></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After downloading, run the setup.exe
installation utility.&nbsp; The installation of the STRCM utility only creates
an installation directory and copies files into this directory.&nbsp; There are
not any registry changes, .dll changes, or system changes performed by
installing the STRCM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are using Hyena, install the STRCM into
Hyena's installation directory.&nbsp; If you are not using Hyena, install the
files into a separate directory.&nbsp; The STRCM utility is <b><i>FREE</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If selected during installation, the source code files for the STRCM will be
installed into a \Source directory.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i>Important Note</i></b>: The STRCM is only meant
  to install a remote control software product on a REMOTE computer.&nbsp; If
  you want to perform a local installation, you may want to consider using the
  remote control software's default installation software, as this will provide
  for various uninstallation (Add/Remove Program), shortcuts, and other
  installation options that the STRCM may not support during remote
  installation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After installation, review the <a href="#Configuration">STRCM

available at <a href="http://www.systemtools.com/hyena">http://www.systemtools.com/hyena</a>.&nbsp;
One of the benefits of using Hyena and the STRCM utility together is that Hyena
provides a variety of methods to display computers in its windows, thereby
providing for one-click access to the STRCM for any selected computer
object.&nbsp; Hyena therefore can become a centralized console for access to any
remote control software product that is configured through the STRCM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">For each STRCM configuration file (.rcm), Hyena will add
a context menu entry to the <b>Remote Control</b> menu for all computer objects
(domain controllers, servers, workstations, etc.).&nbsp; The <b><i>MenuName</i></b>
setting in the .rcm file is used for the menu title.&nbsp; Hyena will search for
the .rcm files in the following locations (in this order):</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Shared Settings directory
    (Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Path to Object Manager...)&nbsp;</font></li>

<p><font face="Verdana">The current active .rcm files found can be viewed under
Hyena's <b>Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Remote Control</b> menu. The STRCM
configuration files can also be view or modified on this dialog.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To activate the STRCM utility for a selected computer in
Hyena, right click, and select the desired remote control configuration from the
<b>Remote Control</b> menu.&nbsp; Hyena will then run the STRCM utility by
executing STRCM.exe, which must be installed in Hyena's installation directory.&nbsp;
Hyena will pass the selected computer's path and the <b><i>View</i></b> option
to the STRCM.&nbsp; If only the tcp/ip address is available for a computer,
enter the computer manually into Hyena's Object Manager, and use the tcp/ip
address for the computer's path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The <b><i>AutoExecute</i></b> STRCM .rcm file setting

<p><font face="Verdana"><b>UnInstallation Limitations</b></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">The STRCM is only designed to remove files and
    registry settings that are part of the STRCM installation procedure.&nbsp;
    For example, the only files removed are as specified in the <b>FileList</b>
    setting, and the location of these files are as specified in the <b>DestinationDirectory</b>
    setting.&nbsp; If the remote control software was originally installed using
    the manufacturer's original installation, items such as program icons,
    shortcuts, and Add/Remove Program entries will <b>NOT</b> be removed.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">The STRCM is only capable of removing registry
    entries that are installed into designated areas based on the remote control
    software being configured.&nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER entries, for example, are
    <b><i>not </i></b>removed.</font></li>

<font SIZE="2">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Why not provide your own remote control software
instead of integrating with existing products ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">We felt that with the maturity and availability of a
wide array of remote control (RC) software solutions, that developing yet
another RC product would not be a good use of development resources.&nbsp; Many
organizations have already standardized on an RC product, and increasingly,
Microsoft has integrated RC into newer releases of Windows.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.systemtools.com/hyena">Hyena</a>
already can invoke any external tool through its custom tools interface.&nbsp;
The STRCM is simply a method that we can use to further integrate Hyena with
existing RC products, while at the same time providing a standalone tool for
more control over existing remote control software products.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Why VNC ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">We selected VNC because its the only (at least that we
know of) free remote control (RC) solution available.&nbsp; Its also extremely
popular and its free.&nbsp; Did we mention that its free ?&nbsp; Its also an
open-source product, so others have taken it and modified it.&nbsp; See the <a href="#VNC_Resources">VNC
resources section</a> for links on&nbsp;VNC-related sites and products.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The STRCM can in theory support any RC software
solution, due to its flexible design.&nbsp; We are not able to redistribute or
provide installation instructions or support for other RC software packages, as
this may violate their licensing requirements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>What about VNC security ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Installing any remote control (RC) software product on a
computer potentially exposes that computer (and the organization that the
computer belongs to) to additional security risks.&nbsp; However, properly
managing how the RC software is installed and configured can help manage these
risks.&nbsp; Depending upon which RC product is used, different techniques to
manage security can be used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The STRCM supports a number of techniques to help
strengthen existing security for all RC products, including VNC. The STRCM can:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Automatically install and set the password for VNC.&nbsp;
    This permits a consistent installation with known configuration options.&nbsp;
    The password can optionally not be stored locally in any configuration file,
    further increasing security.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Automatically stop the VNC service when the viewer
    exits.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana">Support renaming of the VNC service and support
    files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">Any organization that is using remote control software
should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the security features and
implications of using different remote control software packages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Why is the STRCM available as open source ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Portions of the STRCM require very specific
functionality in order to correctly install VNC.&nbsp; In particular, the VNC
password must be computed using a specific algorithm in order to encrypt the
password correctly. Therefore, some source code routines from the VNC
distribution were used for some portions of the STRCM.&nbsp; We thereby feel
that it is desirable to make the STRCM product open source under the GNU
licensing provisions.&nbsp; Also, this permits some organizations to modify the
STRCM for their own specific needs.&nbsp; SystemTools Software Inc. is committed
to respecting the contributions of others involved in the VNC project, and any
organization that further develops or modifies the STRCM utility must do the
same under the GNU licensing provisions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>What support options do you offer for the STRCM ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">SystemTools Software will offer support if there are
specific identified problems with the STRCM.&nbsp; We also gladly accept
feedback and suggestions on ways to improve the STRCM utility.&nbsp; Due to the
variety of configurations possible with any remote control software product, we
can't offer support for VNC, any VNC variation (Tridia, TightVNC, etc.) or any
other remote control software product.&nbsp; All of these packages have some
support options of their own.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Prior to asking for help or assistance with the STRCM,
make sure that the remote control software product works independently of and
from the STRCM.&nbsp; For support, send an email to <a href="mailto:support@systemtools.com">support@systemtools.com</a>
or visit the Remote Control section of our online discussion board at <a href="http://www.systemtools.com/HyenaBoard">http://www.systemtools.com/HyenaBoard</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Why did you develop the STRCM using the Microsoft
Foundation Class (MFC) library ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.systemtools.com/hyena" target="_blank">Hyena
(http://www.systemtools.com/hyena)</a> was already developed using MFC, so we
were naturally familiar with its use.&nbsp; Today, this is a very common
framework, so the required .DLL files are usually already installed.&nbsp; Using
MFC allowed us to develop the entire STRCM project in a couple of days.&nbsp; We
chose not to use Unicode libraries only because of the inclusion of some
non-Unicode functions from the original VNC code modules, and did not feel that
a Unicode build would offer any significant advantages.&nbsp;</font></p>
